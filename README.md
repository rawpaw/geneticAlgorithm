# geneticAlgorithm
This project showcases the use of a genetic algorithm to solve a topological problem. 

# The problem
A number of deadzones (cirlces) are generated within a bounded area, and the genetic algorithm needs to find the largest circle that can fit between the deadzones (i.e no overlap/intersect).
